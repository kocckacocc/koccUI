oUF_GCD_frame HowTo

If you don't have oUF installed, install it.

The easiest way to test that the cooldown is working is to specify a frame
in your layout that will contain the animation.  For instance, your player 
health bar:

	if (unit == 'player') then
		self.GCD_frame = self.Health
	end

This should allow you to see the cooldown animation when the GCD is active.
You could also place it in your portrait, over the target frame, or any
other frame you'd like. This probably isn't what you want though, so you can 
create your own frame which will hold the GCD animation. I use something 
similar to the following:

	if (unit == 'player' and IsAddOnLoaded('oUF_GCD_frame')) then		
		local frame = CreateFrame('Frame')
		frame:SetPoint('CENTER', 0, 0)
		frame:SetAlpha(0.3)
		frame:SetWidth(128)
		frame:SetHeight(128)
		frame.GCD_hideFrame = true
		frame:Hide()
		
		local icon = frame:CreateTexture(nil, 'BACKGROUND')
		icon:SetAllPoints()
		icon:SetTexture("Interface\\AddOns\\oUF_GCD_frame\\stop.tga")
		
		self.GCD_frame = frame
	end

This will show a big 'not' icon in the center of your screen when the GCD is
active. It will disappear when the GCD finishes (as specified by 
GCD_hideFrame.) You can also create your own cooldown to adjust the its
settings, but by default is is defined as follows:

	local cooldown = CreateFrame('Cooldown', nil, self.GCD_frame, 'CooldownFrameTemplate')
	cooldown:SetPoint('CENTER', 0, -1)
	cooldown:SetHeight(self.GCD_frame:GetHeight())
	cooldown:SetWidth(self.GCD_frame:GetWidth())
	self.GCD_frame.Cooldown = cooldown

That's pretty much it. Enjoy.
